The company, founded by <a href="http://talukdar.net/">Dr. Talukdar</a> – assistant professor in <a href="http://www.cds.iisc.ac.in/">The Department of Computational and Data Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a>, Bangalore – sits in the space between research and industry. The company was just a couple of months old when I joined in February 2018 and I was given the responsibility of developing predictive models for all kinds of time-series data like stock prices (real-valued data), items demand (positive count valued data), by using structured (usual time-series data) as well as unstructured data (text data like tweets, blogs, etc.)</p> <p>Starting from literature survey, I developed state of the art, scalable and versatile, recurrent neural network based model for timeseries predictions, called <strong>KIP-Timeseries</strong>. The highlights of the model are its:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Versatility</strong>: It can be used for prediction of all kinds of timeseries data ranging from demand forecasting to stock-market price prediction,</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scalability</strong>: It can be scaled to include any number of structured and unstructured data source,</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Usefulness</strong>: It provides probabilistic predictions instead of point predictions. These can be used to make more informed decisions in various real-life business scenarios.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Using <strong>KIP-Timeseries</strong> and <strong>KIP-Social Sensing</strong> (an aggregate sentiment analyser which we developed at Kenome), we (a team of three engineers) developed a crypto-currency price prediction tool called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AnJdju1ry4" title="TrakCrypto">TrakCrypto</a> – one of the first Kenome product deployed at an enterprise level. The model and the platform is constantly being improved.</p> <p><img src="https://dhruveshp.com/assets/img/trakcrypto.png" alt="TrakCrypto"/></p> <p>Also worked in a small team developing <strong>Kenome Insights Platform (KIP)</strong>, a set of end-to-end pipelines for various Machine Learning tasks. It consists of data collection, data storage, ML models and deployment pipelines. In particular, I have developed a deep transfer-learning based model for the sentiment analysis of financial news headlines. Following are the libraries/frameworks I have been using in my work at Kenome:</p> <ol> <li> <p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://dash.plot.ly/">Dash</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://plot.ly/plotly-js-scientific-d3-charting-library/">Plotly</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Mongodb</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">ElasticSearch</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html">Statsmodels</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://docs.python-eve.org/en/latest/">Python Eve</a></p> </li> </ol> <p>Since I was one of the first few engineers at Kenome, I was involved in selection of organization wide development tools and workflows: code style, issue tracking, testing, deployment, etc. and various other engineering decisions which are generally exclusively handled by senior managers in big companies. This additional responsibility and exposure to end-to-end development cycle of data centric software has provided me with the confidence to handle much bigger projects in future.</p> </p> </div> </div> <div class="item"> <i class="vertical-line"></i> <h2 class="item-date">06/2016 - 01/2018 </h2> <div class="card-panel"> <a href="https://www.mathworks.com"> <h3 class="card-title"> Mathworks </h3> </a> <p> <p>After finishing my <a href="https://dhruveshp.com/timeline/iitm">Dual Degree (BTech+MTech) at IIT Madras</a>; after working on problems involving scientific computation for a couple of years, getting placed at MathWorks was a dream come true. I joined MathWorks India and started working out of Bangalore office on July 4th, 2016. Starting from minor projects with one of the Simulink Teams, within a few months I graduated to a full-time software engineer doing some serious code-wrangling. I learned and sharpened most of the software engineering as well as computer science related skills at the job.</p> <p>Being part of one of the major development teams based out of India, which worked on the development of core features of <a href="https://mathworks.com/products/simulink.html">Simulink</a> – one of the two flagship products of MathWorks – I was required to leverage knowledge of data structures; design patterns; key concepts of operating systems like memory management, runtime optimization, etc. Working mostly with C++11 and a bit of java, I finished two major projects which went out as features in two separate releases of the product.</p> <p>I developed the following skills during this time:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Expert level proficiency in C++11 and C++17 including the newest features of the language.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deeper understanding of core concepts of computer science: Operating Systems; compilers, debuggers and binaries (ELF)</p> </li> <li> <p>Understanding of various stages of stable development workflow (requirements-specs-development-testing-deployment)</p> </li> </ol> <p>During this time, in order to gain some insights into the working of operating systems, compilers and debuggers, I worked on some pet-projects in my free time: a <a href="https://github.com/dhruvdcoder/Intelibugger">tiny C++ debugger</a> directly using the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace system call</a> on linux systems; a binary introspection utility like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objdump">objdump</a>/<a href="http://wiki.dwarfstd.org/index.php?title=Libdwarf_And_Dwarfdump">dwarfdump</a> using <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> library.</p> </p> </div> </div> <div class="item"> <i class="vertical-line"></i> <h2 class="item-date">06/2016 - 01/2018 </h2> <div class="card-panel"> <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in"> <h3 class="card-title"> IIT Madras </h3> </a> <p> <p>After getting through IIT-JEE 2011 with All India Rank of 1947, I enrolled into the Department of Engineering Design, IIT Madras as an undergrad student. My journey through the college was a rather busy one. Apart from the courses, which in themselves demand enormous effort to master, I was involved in various other activities like: sports, hostel student council, volunteering at college fests, participating in tech competitions – the list goes on..</p> <h1 id="academics">Academics</h1> <p>The most important part of any student’s college life is the academics and I was no exception. The Dual Degree (Btech + Mtech) at the Dept. of Engineering Design has a unique curricullum which, in my humble opinion, is a bit ahead of its time. The curriculum teaches aspects of engineering and product development by focussing on the core fields of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering. Such an outlook helped me broaden my understanding of basic principles and gain maturity as an engineer.</p> <p>I had always been mathematically inclined and strived to understand everything from first principles and with a logical and mathematical framework. This lead me to pick courses which were math heavy and very involved. Following are some worth mentioning:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Linear Algebra and Optimization</strong></p> <p>Vector spaces, linear maps and associated subspaces, matrices and their factorizations, principles of convex optimization, Linear Programming, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> for solving convex optimization problems</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>PDEs and Numerical Methods</strong></p> <p>Types of PDEs and their analytical solutions, numerical methods for solving PDEs</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>System Identification*</strong></p> <p>Estimating the parameters of Linear Dynamical Systems (continuous and discrete) from noisy input-output data; Properties of Linear Systems; Statistical Estimators: MLE, Least Squares, Bayesian, etc., <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/sysid.html">System Identification Toolbox</a> for signal transformations, parameter estimation, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc17_ch03/preview"><strong>Applied Time Series Analysis*</strong></a></p> <p>Time domain and spectral analysis of discrete and continuous signals; statistical properties like ergodicty, stationarity, auto-correlations, partial auto-correlations, etc. of signals; model properties for linear time-series models like Auto-regressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), ARMA, ARIMA, etc.; parameter estimation for the models; <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R Language</a></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Advanced Applied Linear Algebra*</strong></p> <p>Theory of Linear Maps, Inner product spaces, metric spaces; Spaces associated with a linear map and its adjoint, vector and matrix norms; matrix/linear map decompositions: SVD, QR, spectral, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Introduction to Mathematical Statistics*</strong></p> <p>Graduate level introduction to Probablity, Statistics and Statistical Inference</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mathematical Modelling in Industry*</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/diffcomp.html"><strong>Differential and Computational Geometry*</strong></a></p> <p>Introduction to computational geometry - triangularization, voronoi diagram, convex hulls, etc.; Introduction to <a href="https://www.cgal.org/">CGAL C++ library</a>; GPU computing for geometry; Gentle introduction to differential geometry</p> </li> </ol> <p>During the last year of my undergrad and during my masters year I worked mainly on Computational aspects of Kinematics, Dynamics and control of Robot Manipulators in the <span id="rblab">Robotics Lab, IIT Madras,</span> under the guidance of <a href="https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/">Dr. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay</a>. Following are the courses which I took on the topic:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Industrial Automation and Robotics</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Controls Lab</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mechatronic System Design*</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>System Identification*</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Design, Analysis and Control of Robot Manipulators*</strong></p> </li> </ol> <p>During my 4th year as a part of my semester-long industrial internship, I worked on building a Vehicle Motion Simulator using MaPaMan, a Parallel Manipulator. Kinematics of polynomial in its full generality is described by a systems of multivariate polynomials of high degrees. Hence in order to tackle problems in the domain, I learned the basics of abstract algebra and algebraic geometry, both – delightfully enlightening topics – contributed immensely to my understanding of geometry and towards increasing my mathematical maturity. On the implementation side, the polynomial equations representing the kinematics of parallel robot manipulators can have hundred and even thousands of terms, making them intractable using pen and paper. Hence I learned symbolic computation principles and used <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> extensively in my work.</p> <iframe id="intern" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KqWk2QGQjLfhfkF5StcBvHZS18z4PWI8/preview" width="800" height="600"></iframe> <p>As my final year project, I worked on the computation of Safe Working Zone for parallel manipulators which resulted in a publication. I wrote a libraray in C++ which can be used to find the Safe Working Zone of any parallel manipulator. The details of my work, link to the paper and the thesis can be found <a href="https://dhruveshp.com/projects/swz">here</a>.</p> <p>Following are some skills which I gained during my Dual Degree (BTech+MTech):</p> <ol> <li> <p>Programming Languages and paradigms :</p> <p>a. General purpose: C, C++, Python</p> <p>b. Mathematical computation: MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python, C, C++; along with some specific libraries writen in these.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technical:</p> <p>a. General Mathematics: ODEs, PDEs, Numerical Methods, Linear Algebra, Probablity and Statistics, Random processes, Linear Systems, Computational and Differential Geometry, Abstract Algebra.</p> <p>b.

Engineering: Basic Electrical Machines, Digital circuits, Mechanics of Machinery.</p> <p>d. End-to-end product development principles</p> <p>e. Some technical writing skills</p> </li> </ol> <p>During my final year project, while writing the library for computation of SWZ of parallel manipulators, I got interesting in software engineering and decided to join MathWorks, the makers of MATLAB and Simulink – arguably the most widely used scientific computation tools in Academia and Industry. <a href="https://dhruveshp.com/exp/mw">Here is how I spent the next 18 months of my life at MathWorks Bangalore</a>.</p> <h1 id="sports">Sports</h1> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded medium-zoom-image" src="https://dhruveshp.com/assets/img/header_four.jpg" data-zoomable=""/> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> IIT Madras hockey team at IIT Roorkee in 2017. The picture was taken right before wining the semifinal against the host. </div> <p>Being from a town which has a name for giving good sportsmen to the country, I was always encouraged to take up sports. I was involved in sports right from my school days and had been playing field hockey since I was ten and had already represented and captained my state at two National Level tournaments (Under-14 and Under-15) before coming to college. Fortunately, IIT Madras had a great atmosphere for sports which allowed me to continue playing hockey. I played for IIT Madras during all five years of my stay there and was part of a team which won 3 golds (2011, 2012, 2013) and 1 silver (2014) at the annual National Inter-IIT sports meet; several first as well as second place finishes at regional and state tournaments. I also captained the team during my final year and was awarded best goingout sports person for the batch of 2016. I was also the captain and mentor for my hostel’s hockey tream. Being fit and acively playing team sports has been an integral part of my upbringing and has instilled maturity and determination into my character as a person.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded medium-zoom-image" src="https://dhruveshp.com/assets/img/header_five.jpg" data-zoomable=""/> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> IIT Guwahati in 2018. </div> </p> </div> </div> <div class="last-item"> <i class="vertical-line"></i> </div> </div> </div> </article></div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> &copy; Copyright 2023 Dhruvesh Patel.
