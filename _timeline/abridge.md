As a summer research intern, worked on information extraction from healthcare conversation transcripts using sparsity inducing attention networks. This work resulted in a <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.clinicalnlp-1.20/">publication</a> at the 3rd Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop at ACL 2020.
